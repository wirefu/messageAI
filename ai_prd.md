# AI Chat Interface - Product Requirements Document

## Overview

The AI Chat Interface is an advanced conversational AI system integrated into the MessageAI app that provides intelligent assistance, cross-user knowledge sharing, and proactive suggestions using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technology.

## Product Vision

Create a dedicated AI assistant that can:
- Answer questions about conversations across the team
- Execute actions like translation, summarization, and analysis
- Provide proactive suggestions based on conversation patterns
- Share knowledge across users while maintaining privacy

## Core Features
