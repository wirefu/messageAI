**Alice:** "Phase 1 is complete - authentication and messaging work great"

**Bob:** "Awesome! What's next?"

**Alice:** "We need to decide on the AI model. I see 3 options"

**Bob:** "What are they?"

**Alice:** "Option 1: GPT-4 for everything - best quality but expensive"

**Alice:** "Option 2: GPT-4o-mini - cheaper but less capable"

**Alice:** "Option 3: Mix both - GPT-4 for summaries, mini for simple tasks"

**Bob:** "I vote for option 3. Best balance of quality and cost"

**Alice:** "Agreed! Let's go with the mixed approach"

**Bob:** "Great. I'll set up the Cloud Functions this week"

**Alice:** "Can you finish by Friday?"

**Bob:** "Yes, I'll deploy by end of day Friday"

**Alice:** "Perfect. One question - how should we handle offline sync?"

**Bob:** "Good question. We need to research that more"

**Alice:** "Let's add that to next week's agenda"

**Bob:** "Sounds good!"

**Result:** 17 messages exchanged between Alice and Bob
