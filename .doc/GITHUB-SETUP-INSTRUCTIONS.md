## 🔧 Step-by-Step GitHub Setup

### Step 1: Create GitHub Repository

**Go to GitHub:**
1. Visit: https://github.com/new
2. Repository name: `messageAI` (or your preferred name)
3. Description: "Intelligent messaging platform for remote teams - Firebase + SwiftUI + AI"
4. **Important:** Choose **Private** or **Public**
5. **Do NOT** initialize with README (we have one)
6. Click "Create repository"

### Step 2: Copy the Repository URL

GitHub will show you commands. **Copy the repository URL**, it looks like:
```
https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/messageAI.git
```

### Step 3: Add Remote and Push

**Run these commands in Terminal:**

```bash
# Navigate to project
cd /Users/yan/gauntlet/messageAI

# Add GitHub as remote (replace URL with yours)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/messageAI.git

# Push all commits
git push -u origin main
```

**If you have 2FA/Token auth:**
```bash
# Use personal access token instead of password
# Create token at: https://github.com/settings/tokens
git push -u origin main
# Username: YOUR_USERNAME
# Password: ghp_YOUR_TOKEN_HERE
```
