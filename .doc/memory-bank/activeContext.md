# Active Context

**Current Status:** Phase 1 Complete + Bug Fixes - Manual Testing Done  
**Last Updated:** October 24, 2025  
**Current Phase:** Phase 1 - Core Messaging (COMPLETE - 100%)

## What Just Happened

### Manual Testing Session (October 24, 2025)
- Set up dual simulator testing environment (iPhone 17 + iPhone 17 Pro)
- Successfully tested real-time messaging between two users
- Discovered and fixed critical bugs during live testing
- All Phase 1 features now working end-to-end

### Bugs Fixed During Testing âœ…

1. **User Discovery Bug**
   - **Problem**: NewConversationView showed "No Users Found" even with registered users
   - **Root Cause**: `loadUsers()` function was empty - not fetching from Firebase
   - **Fix**: Added `getAllUsers()` method to UserRepository and implemented user loading
   - **Files**: `UserRepository.swift`, `NewConversationView.swift`

2. **Conversation List Crash**
   - **Problem**: User 2's app crashed when receiving a message from User 1
   - **Root Cause**: `Conversation.from()` used JSONDecoder to parse lastMessage, which couldn't handle Firestore Timestamps
   - **Fix**: Manual parsing of lastMessage dictionary with proper Timestamp conversion
   - **File**: `Conversation.swift`

### Testing Results âœ…
- âœ… Two-user setup working
- âœ… User discovery working
- âœ… Conversation creation working
- âœ… Real-time message sending working
- âœ… No crashes on message receive
- âœ… Conversation list updates in real-time

### Git Status
- **Repository**: https://github.com/wirefu/messageAI
- **Branch**: main
- **Latest Commit**: `1d6ddf4` - "fix: resolve crash in conversation list and add user discovery"
- **Commits Today**: 1 bug fix commit
- **Total Commits**: 15 commits on GitHub

## Current Project State

### Files Changed Today (3 files)
1. **MessageAI/MessageAI/Models/Conversation.swift**
   - Fixed `from(document:)` to properly parse lastMessage
   - Handles Firestore Timestamps correctly

2. **MessageAI/MessageAI/Repositories/UserRepository.swift**
   - Added `getAllUsers(excludingUserID:)` method
   - Protocol updated with new method signature

3. **MessageAI/MessageAI/Views/Conversations/NewConversationView.swift**
   - Implemented `loadUsers()` function
   - Added UserRepository instance
   - Now actually fetches and displays users

### Source Code Status
- **Source files**: 38 Swift files
- **Test files**: 19 test files, 62 test cases
- **SwiftLint**: 0 violations

### What Works (Manually Verified Today) âœ…
1. **Authentication Flow**
   - Sign up with email/password
   - Login
   - Multiple users can register

2. **User Discovery**
   - New Conversation button shows all users
   - Search functionality
   - User online status indicators

3. **Messaging**
   - Create conversation with another user
   - Send messages
   - Receive messages in real-time
   - Messages appear on both devices instantly
   - No crashes or errors

4. **Conversation List**
   - Shows all conversations
   - Real-time updates when new messages arrive
   - Displays last message preview
   - Shows user status

## Next Steps

### Phase 2: AI Features (PRs #17-24)
Ready to implement AI-powered features:
- Smart Summarization
- Clarity Assistant  
- Action Item Extraction
- Tone Analysis

**Estimated Time**: 8-10 hours

### Phase 3: Testing & Deployment (PRs #25-27)
Final polish and production prep:
- Integration testing
- Production configuration
- App Store preparation

**Estimated Time**: 2-3 hours

## Development Environment

### Tools Status âœ…
- Xcode: Working
- Simulators: iPhone 17 & iPhone 17 Pro configured
- Git: All changes committed and pushed
- Firebase: Connected (production, not emulator during this test)
- SwiftLint: 0 violations maintained

### Manual Testing Setup
- **Device 1**: iPhone 17 Simulator
- **Device 2**: iPhone 17 Pro Simulator
- **Test Users**: user1@test.com, user2@test.com
- **Connection**: Firebase production backend

## Quality Metrics

- **SwiftLint Violations**: 0 âœ…
- **Build Status**: âœ… Successful
- **Manual Tests**: âœ… All passed
- **Crashes**: 0 (fixed during session)
- **Git Status**: Clean, all changes committed
- **Code Protection**: All work backed up on GitHub

## Key Learnings from Testing

1. **Manual testing reveals real issues** - Both bugs only appeared during actual usage
2. **Dual simulator testing is essential** - Need two devices to test real-time messaging
3. **Firestore Timestamp handling is tricky** - JSONDecoder can't handle them, need manual parsing
4. **Empty implementations fail silently** - loadUsers() was empty but didn't error
5. **Real-time features work great** - Firebase real-time sync is instant and reliable
